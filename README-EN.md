## üöÄ Introduction | Intro

**Erupt** is a universal low-code framework driven by Java annotations that dynamically renders and constructs pages and APIs.

Zero front-end code, zero CURD, and automatic table creation ‚Äî only one class file with annotation configuration is required to quickly develop enterprise-grade data management backends.

Highly extensible, supporting CURD customization via `@DataProxy`, custom data sources, soft delete, LDAP, OSS, and more.

## üéØ Low-Code Engine | Engine

#### Transparent Mechanics & High Configurability:

* **Annotation-driven, flexible configuration:** Control model behavior, UI rendering, data validation, and processing through annotations like `@Erupt`, `@EruptField`, and their rich properties.
* **Open architecture:** Erupt‚Äôs modular core encourages developers to understand its internal mechanisms and adjust them as needed.
* **Detailed logs and debugging support:** Helps developers track issues and understand internal execution flows.

#### Beyond Traditional Code Generators:

* **Runtime interpretation over static generation:** Erupt dynamically constructs applications through annotation parsing, avoiding bloated, hard-to-maintain generated code.
* **Model-focused development:** Developers only need to define business models and annotations ‚Äî Erupt handles UI rendering, data binding, API calls, and database interactions automatically.

#### Deep Customization and Extensibility:

* **Lifecycle hooks:** Key lifecycle points expose hooks for extending and adjusting behavior.
* **`@DataProxy` interface:** Inject custom logic during data operations (e.g., before add, after edit, on query) for validations, transformations, permission control, etc.
* **Custom components and views:** Easily integrate personalized front-end components or templates beyond built-in options.
* **Custom data sources and dialects:** Extend support for specific databases or create your own SQL dialect adapters.

#### Embracing the Spring Boot Ecosystem:

* **Non-intrusive design:** Built on Spring Boot with deep Spring Data JPA integration without interfering with other Spring or third-party libraries.
* **Standard JPA entities:** Erupt entity classes are standard JPA entities, reusable across other services or modules.
* **Easy to integrate into existing projects:** Erupt Cloud can be progressively integrated to enhance or replace backend modules in existing Spring Boot projects.

> Since 2020, Erupt has been continuously optimized and upgraded. It's already used by hundreds of companies and thousands of developers. Hundreds have contributed feature suggestions and code.

## ü•è Beyond Code Generators

While code generators improve efficiency, they produce large volumes of template code that are difficult to maintain and prone to technical debt once modified.

Erupt offers a more elegant solution:

* **Elevating configuration to code:** Erupt doesn‚Äôt generate code; it dynamically interprets annotations. Business logic is decoupled from core framework behavior ‚Äî changing an annotation instantly updates system behavior.
* **Higher abstraction:** Erupt abstracts common backend features into standardized annotations and components. Developers focus solely on business model definitions.
* **Ongoing evolution and maintenance:** As a mature open-source framework, the Erupt team and community continuously enhance features and fix issues. You benefit from framework updates without maintaining generated code.
